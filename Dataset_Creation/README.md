This code is responsible for scanning the reports (as PDFs) and extracting all images that fall under the "observation and recommendation" sections of the reports and turing these images into a structured dataset of labeled data. The labels are determined by utilizing the adjacent text to each image and pairing it with a label from forsmith_roof_labels.json.
